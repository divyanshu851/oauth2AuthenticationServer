Here's the revised project description, incorporating the integration of third-party product fetching and updating requests:

### eCommerce Platform with OAuth2 Authentication

**Project Title:** eCommerce Platform with OAuth2 Authentication

**Project Overview:**
Developed a robust and scalable eCommerce platform designed to provide a seamless and secure shopping experience. The platform comprises two microservices: an OAuth2 Authentication Server for handling user authentication and authorization, and the main eCommerce Site for managing product and category operations. This project integrates modern security standards and comprehensive eCommerce features to ensure both usability and safety for end users.

**Microservices:**

1. **OAuth2 Authentication Server:**
   - **Description:**
     Designed to manage secure user authentication and authorization, this microservice implements the OAuth2 framework, supporting various grant types such as authorization code, password, client credentials, and refresh tokens.
   - **Key Features:**
     - Secure user registration and login processes with bcrypt for password hashing.
     - JWT-based access token generation for secure and stateless authentication.
     - Comprehensive API for user management, including registration, login, and token handling.
     - MySQL database integration for efficient and secure storage of user credentials and tokens.
     - API documentation and testing facilitated through Swagger UI.
   - **Technologies Used:**
     - Spring Boot, Spring Security
     - OAuth2, JWT
     - MySQL
     - Maven
     - Swagger UI

2. **eCommerce Site:**
   - **Description:**
     The main eCommerce site microservice provides a complete suite of eCommerce functionalities, focusing on product and category management, integrated seamlessly with the OAuth2 Authentication Server.
   - **Key Features:**
     - User authentication and profile management integrated with the OAuth2 Authentication Server for secure access.
     - Detailed product catalog with functionalities to add and remove products.
     - Category management system allowing the addition and removal of product categories.
     - Integration with third-party services to fetch and update product information.
     - Secure storage of product and category data in a MySQL database.
   - **Technologies Used:**
     - Spring Boot, Hibernate
     - Thymeleaf for dynamic front-end rendering
     - MySQL for database management
     - JavaScript, HTML, CSS for responsive UI development

**Responsibilities:**
- **Architecture & Design:**
  - Architected the microservices structure ensuring modularity, scalability, and efficient interaction between the authentication server and the main eCommerce platform.
  - Designed the database schema for both microservices to support secure and efficient data management.

- **Development:**
  - Implemented OAuth2 authentication and authorization mechanisms, ensuring compliance with security best practices.
  - Developed RESTful APIs for user management, product catalog, and category management functionalities.
  - Integrated third-party services for fetching and updating product information.
  - Created responsive and interactive front-end components using Thymeleaf and JavaScript.

- **Integration:**
  - Integrated the OAuth2 Authentication Server with the eCommerce site to provide a seamless and secure user experience.
  - Managed third-party integrations for product data, ensuring up-to-date information and smooth operation.

- **Testing & Documentation:**
  - Conducted extensive unit and integration testing to ensure the reliability, performance, and security of the platform.
  - Documented API endpoints and user guides using Swagger UI and other documentation tools to facilitate developer and user understanding.

- **Collaboration:**
  - Worked closely with team members, including front-end developers and database administrators, to streamline the development process and ensure timely delivery of features.
  - Participated in code reviews and provided feedback to maintain code quality and adherence to best practices.
